# COGS189-Final-Project

## Synopsis
A distractive working environment and a overly-exhausted mind can greatly undermine out productivity, but we are often unaware of these factors during work. In our final project, we want to create a system that designs an optimal environment and plan for people by recognizing their mental states during work. Our goal is to use EEG potentials to determine whether the user is in a stressful and unproductive working state and provide them constructive/real-time feedback so that they can be more efficient.
